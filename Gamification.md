## Definition ##

What is _gamification_? There are [several definitions](http://enterprise-gamification.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Gamification_Definition) for the word, and the one most closely related to our purposes seems to be the following, by [Gabe Zimmermann](http://www.amazon.in/The-Gamification-Revolution-Zichermann/dp/1259098559/): "Gamification is implementing design concepts from games, loyalty programs, and behavioral economics to drive user engagement." In layman's terms, a website employing gamification hopes that virtual rewards will convince users to do what they would normally not bother doing - such as shouting out "Hey, I just walked in Starbucks!" to add yet another voice to the cacophony that is social media.

## History ##

Before the commencement of its widespread use in the website vernacular in 2010, the term was coined by British computer programmer [Nick Pelling](http://www.nickpelling.com/) in 2002. Pelling, who was a game designer and developer until then, started working on embedded design, and thought that user interfaces on electronic devices (mobile phones, ATM machines, etc.) would be more fun and faster to use if they incorporated gaming elements. He was 8 years ahead of his time, and interest was low - in [his words](http://nanodome.wordpress.com/2011/08/09/the-short-prehistory-of-gamification/): "I tried to make money from it, failed miserably, pulled out long before anyone else used it, and that was pretty much the end of my involvement. Oh well! :-)".

## Techniques & Examples ##

Gamification techniques include the following.
  * **Points:** Every time a user does a certain task, they are awarded with some points. These are food for the ego, but not the body. For example, [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/) rewards points to users according to a certain set of [criteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foursquare#Scoring).
  * **Badges/Achievements:** Certain tasks or milestones may be awarded with badges or achievements. An [example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Academy#Badges) is [Khan Academy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Academy#Badges), a non-profit educational website.
  * **Quests:** Quests usually require the user to perform some set of related activities, such as [fitness exercises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitocracy#Game) on [Fitocracy](https://www.fitocracy.com/), an online fitness/social networking site.
  * **Competition:** This might involve leaderboards to keep track of how people are doing. Furthermore, the "best" among a certain group of people in a certain amount of time can be awarded with a title. For example, the person who checks into a particular place most frequently during the last 60 days is crowned ["Mayor"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foursquare#Mayorship) in Foursquare.
  * **Leveling Up:** After reaching a certain amount of points, users reach a new level. With great power comes great responsibility, as in the case of [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), where a high level allows users to not only ask and answer questions, but moderate the site.

## Discussion ##

Gamification has certainly enjoyed popularity and helped earn commercial success in the last few years - a [plethora of examples](http://www.enterprise-gamification.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Facts_%26_Figures) attest to that. In a particularly outstanding example, it even helped forward the frontiers of human knowledge: gamers have [succeeded in figuring out an enzyme's structure in 3 weeks](http://scienceblog.com/47894/gamers-succeed-where-scientists-fail/) - an enzyme which had stumped scientists for 15 years.

However, there is some controversy on the methods, if not the results themselves. Game designer and entrepreneur [Jon Radoff](http://radoff.com/blog/about/) [criticizes](http://radoff.com/blog/2011/02/16/gamification/) current gamification techniques to be too result-oriented, whereas he says good games are "fundamentally fun to play" and focus on the journey, not the destination. Researcher [Sebastian Deterding](http://codingconduct.cc/About) ["pawns"](http://www.slideshare.net/dings/pawned-gamification-and-its-discontents) gamification, saying that in addition to the fact that it does not truly reflect games, it has some unintended consequences. For example, the (late) "social gaming" site [Akoha](http://blog.akoha.com/) rewards users with points when they complete missions, which require the user to perform acts of kindness towards other people. However, a noble intention ended with disastrous consequences when a female friend of Deterding's (say X) invited another (male) friend of his (Y) over to coffee, and when Y asked "Why did you invite me over to coffee?", X replied "Because of this game I play." Imagine hearing that.

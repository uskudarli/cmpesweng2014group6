# About Me #

I was born on January 16th, 1992 in Istanbul and have been living in the city since then. Graduated from Istanbul Ataturk High School of Science in 2009. I have a penchant for learning new languages, both natural and programming. Aside from computer, aerospace engineering is another field I find most intriguing.

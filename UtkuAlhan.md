# About Me #

I'm a 4th year undergraduate student who studies Computer Engineering (and double-majors with Mathematics) in [Boğaziçi University](http://www.boun.edu.tr). Lately, I've been particularly interested in [topology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology).

Other than that, I'm a basketball fan, and I enjoy playing chess. I'd love to play chess with you, the potential reader, in front of the ETA building, with the big pieces.

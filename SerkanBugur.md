# Introduction #

# About #

I am a big fan of video games. Especially, I love World Of Warcraft and DOTA 2. I have played almost 600 hours of DOTA 2 last year. I can't blame anyone for saying "You have no life!". I also like almost all sports.


About my programming skills, I learned most of the my knowledge about programming in university. In addition to the courses I took, I tried to learn some popular programming languages and did some small projects of mine.

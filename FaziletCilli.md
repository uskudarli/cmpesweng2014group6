Hi, I am a senior student in CmpE, currently in 9th semester. I graduated from Konya Meram Science High school. In my 7th semester, I spent 4 months in Seattle, studying at <a href='http://www.washington.edu'>University of Washington</a> as an exchange student. I have experience in ASP .NET Mvc programming and Matlab.

As time goes by what lives in the memories vs what we see around is changes. Have you ever took your friend somewhere and told them about how things used to be there? Perhaps there was an ice cream shop that made the best pistachio ice cream and that your family would go there on summer nights. That place no longer physically exists, but does so in memories. Many books and films depict how things were.

This application will let people describe how a particular part of the world used to be at some given time. Naturally, the same location will have different memories that change over time and different perspectives depending on personal views. The descriptions will include the place (maybe places), the time (may be approximate and the exact time may be not known), and the description. Pictures, videos, and sound recordings can be used in the description.

The memories can be search and browsed. Searches can be by location, type of memory. When looking at any given memory, the map should show the location.

People who are interested in the same areas or similar kinds of memories are likely to be interested in similar memories. In fact it might be interesting to connect people based on similar memories. This application will recommend interesting memories and users.

User can give feedback related to a memory, such as "I remember that!" and so on.

Use gamification to motivate the contribution of memories.

This application will have a web and mobile client.

# Recommendation Systems #

Recommendation systems can be described as an information filtering technology which is used to retrieve information on items to the user that are in line with the user’s taste. Recommendation systems can be seen as smart search engines which gather information on users and or items in order to give customized recommendations by comparing users or items with each other. Businesses often have a large variety of products that are for sale. As the number of products increase customers will have more difficulty finding what they like. Recommendation systems offer a solution as they are designed to provide customers with recommendations. As recommendations reduce the amount of time a customer needs to invest in searching for products of his or her liking, the overall user’s experience is positive. Recommendation systems improve customer satisfaction and loyalty; furthermore they increase cross-selling. Recommendation systems use a number of diﬀerent technologies. These could be classified  into two broad groups: Content based filtering systems and collaborative filtering systems.


Content based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and the profile of the users’ choice. They examine the properties of the items recommended. Keywords are used to describe the items and also building a user profile to indicate the type of the item the user likes makes sense. For instance if a user has searched for memory that is  ‘How old bazaar in Istanbul was used to be in 15th century ?’, system can recommend the other memories related to the old bazaar in Istanbul and maybe some other memories that has breathed in 15th century. In this case keywords could be ‘old bazaar’, ‘Istanbul’ and ‘15th century’. As for the collaborative filtering systems, it recommends items based on similarity  measures between users and items. Collecting and analyzing a large amount of data on users’ choices, activities and afterwards predicting what users will like based on similarities to other users are fundamental. The items that are recommended to a user are those preferred by similar users. To find customers who are similar to the user, cluster models could be used. It divides the customer base into many segments and treat the task as a classification problem. The algorithm’s goal is to assign the user to the appropriate segment with the other similar customers. It then generates recommendations accordingly. There also exists Hybrid recommendation systems that combines these two together could be more efficient in some cases. Demographic recommendation system provides recommendations based on a demographic profile of the user. And last one knowledge-based recommendation system suggests products based on inferences about a users’ needs and preferences. This knowledge sometimes contains explicit functional knowledge about how certain products meet user preferences.


Lots of algorithms have been used in measuring similarity in recommendation systems.  One example is k-nearest neighbor. It simply stores all of its training data in memory. In order to classify a new, unlabeled item the algorithm compares it to all stored items using a similarity function and determines the nearest neighbor or the k nearest neighbors. The label or numeric score for a previously unlabeled item can then be derived from the class labels of the nearest neighbors. The whole data should be kept in memory. So one issue to handle here is scarcity of data. There should be a big number of users and memories in the system. However a user might search for a few memories. It is not possible for him or her to search for all of them. We only label the items he or she searched so the others in the graph would be empty.
